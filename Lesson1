HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
It is a markup language which describes the structure of a web page.
HTML elements are called tags.
The tags label a web page’s content such as its heading, title, paragraphs, and more.
Browsers use the tags to render the content of the page and will not display them.
Think of HTML tags as the building blocks for web pages

Why should you learn HTML and CSS?
Learning any language coding or spoken will be beneficial to your career.  Also, having an understanding of HTML and CSS, you will have a deeper knowledge of the internet.

A simple structure for a web page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<br>I’m on the next line.

</body>
</html>

Going line by line:
<!DOCTYPE html> - specifies that this document uses HTML5 markup language
<html> - root element of an HTML page
<head> - contains meta information about the document which is data about the HTML document.  The <head> tag goes between the <html> tag & the <body> tags.
<title> - title used in the browser 
<body> - place for the visible content for the page
<h1> - largest heading, most important heading
<h6> - smallest heading least important heading
<p> - defines a paragraph
<br>	- single line break, no closing end tag necessary
The HTML portion of the document begins at <html> and ends at </html>.
The visible portion is between <body> and </body>.

<tagname> place your content here, picture, words, etc</tagname>

A few more important tags:
<img> - image tag
<a> - link tag

There are more, but we will touch on them later.

With tags, we can use attributes.  Attributes are used to provide additional information for HTML tags.

Attributes are always in the opening tag
Attributes are key/value pairs like: name="value"

<tagname name="value">

Important attributes.
href - a specified destination for a link, image, etc
src - source file
alt - alternative text
style - sets the style of HTML tag
height and width are also attributes

The alt attribute is useful if the image does not exist or browser usage for the blind.

Examples:
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>

<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>

What happens with this snippet of code?

<img src=”oscar.jpg” alt=”my cat”> 
What is this a picture of?

<h2 style=”color: pink”>I’m sort of a big deal; I’m heading 2</h2> 
What is the text going to look like?

Other important attributes:
background-color - sets the background color of the HTML element
color - changes the text color
font-family - changes the  text fonts
font-size - alters text sizes
Use text-align - aligns the  text of the HTML element


On a side note:
<!--  This is how you write comments.  -->

<!--  Either with one line
or two -->

<!--  Either with one line
or two
Or three or more  →




















CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS are like a set of instruction on how HTML elements are to be displayed.

It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.  CSS technology saves a lot of work!


CSS can be added to an HTML document in 3 ways:

Inline - using the style attribute for HTML elements
Internal - using a <style> tag in the <head> section
External - in an external CSS file

Externally is the most common way to add CSS styles to an HTML document.

<link> - used to incorporate an external CSS file

An Example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">

The link, rel is stating that this is a stylesheet.
The href points to the css file.

An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML and have a .css extension.  Each line mush end in a semi-colon ‘;’.

Here is an example of css being used internally in an HTML document.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color:green;
  font-family: Lobster;
  font-size: 325%;
}
p  {
  color: orange;
  font-family:arial;
  font-size: 160%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>This is a great paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Using google’s stylesheets.
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
 
 
Why use external fonts?
It gives you more of a variety to style your web page.  An example is Libre Barcode 39.  This font will convert your text into barcode.  Using third party code will greatly reduce your coding time.

Google fonts:
https://fonts.google.com/

Have a look at all the available fonts.

Google has documentation for their HTML/CSS resources.
https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html


Before you use any third-party products read it’s documentation.  It will save you time when it comes to debugging and understanding errors.  Take a minute to read through the coding practices.  Practicing good coding principles is essential when working in a group or if you must go back and alter your code for future projects.

JavaScript
JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
It is the programming language of HTML and the Web and it’s fairly easy to learn.

New HTML tag:
<script> - used to define a client-side script in this case JavaScript
 
<script> contains script statements, or it points to an external script file.  Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and making web content dynamic.
 
To select an HTML element, JavaScript very often uses the document.getElementById() method.
 
To select an HTML element by it’s class attribute use document.getElementsByClassName() method.
 
<script>
document.getElementById("greetings").innerHTML = "Hi There";
</script>
 
This JavaScript example writes "Hi There" into an HTML element with id="greetings".  The id and class attributes are very important to Javascript.  

Examples:
document.getElementById("image").src = "picture.gif";
document.getElementById("myText").style.fontSize = "25px";
document.getElementsByClassName(“nodOff”).style.color=”puple”;
document.getElementById("mellowState").style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
document.getElementsByClassName(“timeTravel”).style.border=”0px”;

Do you know what each number does?  
 
Below is an example of HTML with Javascript.  It uses internal JavaScript.  Like CSS, Javascript can be internal, external and inline.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

<p id="para1"></p>

</body>
</html> 


JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and create. It is based on JavaScript Programming Language. JSON is a text format that is used in any programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. Since JSON is widely accessible, it is an ideal data-interchange language.

JSON is built on two structures:

A collection of name/value pairs.

An ordered list of values. 

These are universal data structures. All modern programming languages support JSON. 

Sample JSON
{
    "shoe": "boot",
    "size": "7w",
    "color": "red"
}
Project 1:

The date returns an integer value that is the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC.

var time = Date();
In this statement we are creating a date variable called time.

The documentation for the Date object is here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date


In this project, I want you to print out the date in a paragraph on a web page.  It must be today’s date.
The date must be formatted MM-DD-YYYY.
The background must be light gray.
The font must be Acme.
The text size for the paragraph is 24px.
The title of the page is Today’s Date.
The headline is Today’s Date.
The text color is slate blue.
Add a link to your favorite.
Place the Date documentation link in the website footer.

Happy Programming!
